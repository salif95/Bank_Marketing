# STAFF_RETENTION
-------
A company's human resources team wants to implement a staff retention policy. The stakes are high, particularly when we take into account the costs associated with recruitment turnover (hiring, integration, training). This policy must therefore identify employees likely to leave the team based on professional involvement.
Staff retention is the process implemented to retain employees within a company by improving working conditions.
