# Subscription to term deposits in a bank

# Problem Statement:-
A marketing campaign refers to initiatives deployed by an institution to promote the purchase or sale of a product or service, thus including advertising, marketing and distribution of products to customers or businesses. Similarly, a Portuguese banking institution plans to run a marketing campaign based on telephone call recordings from their latest initiative to predict whether its customers will subscribe to term deposits. Records of their actions are available as dataset.

A term deposit is a financial product offered by banking institutions where customers deposit a sum of money for a specific period at a fixed interest rate. Term deposits provide banks with a stable and predictable source of funding.

# Project Objective :-
The objective of the project is to develop a machine learning model to predict if customer contacted will subscribe to a a term deposit.
